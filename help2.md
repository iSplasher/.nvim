### Summary of Keymap Benefits
- **Default Keymaps** provide the foundation for efficient text navigation, editing, and window/buffer management.
- **Plugin Keymaps** enhance capabilities with powerful features like fuzzy finding (Telescope), directional movement (Leap), and file exploration (`nvim-tree`).
- **Custom Keymaps** are tailored to boost workflow efficiency, making operations like buffer switching, file management, and formatting much more convenient.

This comprehensive keymap guide is designed to help you get the most out of your Neovim configuration, whether you're editing text, managing buffers, or navigating code with advanced plugins.
